    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Inception is a science-fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. It follows Dom Cobb, a professional thief who
      enters people's dreams to steal secrets. He is offered a chance to regain his old life if he can successfully plant
      an idea inside a powerful businessman's mind — a process known as inception. As the mission dives deeper into
      layered dreams, the line between reality and illusion begins to blur.
